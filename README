Works in conjunction with Twittov (http://www.yaymukund.com/twittov/) to 
tweet its mashings, possibly via cron.

You will need python, twittov, HTML::Entities and Net::Twitter::Lite.

You will also need to set up twitter to work with oauth.

Run twittov manually on the command line in the directory where it lives 
before you attempt to use this script. Twittov may take a very long time 
to go through all your tweets the first time while it builds its cache 
file, and you may get a couple of timeout errors and have to retry it a 
few times. This will only be a problem until it completes its first run.

After setting up basic path and twitter configuration, this script should work suitably for most people. You may want to add your own exclusions/regexes/tweaks to the 'Quality Control' section.
